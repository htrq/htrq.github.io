00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:14.238
Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.

2
00:00:14.438 --> 00:00:20.110
Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.

3
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.049
I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.

4
00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.461
I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.

5
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:32.464
But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.

6
00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:34.957
Once I have that, it's...

7
00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:36.278
Oink, oink.

8
00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:39.848
Shit.

9
00:00:40.048 --> 00:00:43.634
So that's where you keep the sugar.

10
00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:44.809
What brings you two here?

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.313

Run out of pants to sniff?

12
00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:50.484
That sounds like hostility, doesn't it?

13
00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.466
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

14
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.514
No, we don't, John.

15
00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:09.086
I just had them polished.

16
00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:20.009
Go and put the kettle on.

17
00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:24.403
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

18
00:01:24.603 --> 00:01:34.603
I'm sweet enough.
