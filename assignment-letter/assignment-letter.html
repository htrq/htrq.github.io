        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h1>
        <p>Dear Eileen,<hr></p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the St. Petersburg State University Philology Faculty to
            study as
            part of your <abbr title="Philosophy Doctor">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your question one by one,
            in
            the
            following sections.</p>
        <h2>Staring dates.</h2>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you staring your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
            could
            start at the behinning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p> You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <p>At the SPSU, we have a pretty open-minded reserch facility â€” as long as the subjects fall somewher in the realm of
            science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to
            have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
            priority/</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Reseveratrol
                (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;(86&deg;F), when the
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3&times;10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3&times;10<sup>4</sup>.)
            </li>
            <li>
                <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect to research to
            take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
        <h2>Exotic dance moves.</h2>
        <p>
            Yes. you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
            question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>
                A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dancing back as fas as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a
                circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
            </dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before theh Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to prectice this dance, which involved
                huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very
                rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as
                Twerking
            </dd>
