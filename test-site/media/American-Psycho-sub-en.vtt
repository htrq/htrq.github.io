1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There are definite dos and don'ts,
good buddy,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid colored

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or discretely patterned suits and ties.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Listen, John, I've got to go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Just joking.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Okay, John. Right… got it.

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Sorry about that.

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Was that anything important?

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Oh, that?
Just mulling over business problems,

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumors,

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
spreading gossip.

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Hi, Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

19
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I know how busy you guys can get.

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, what's the, uh…

22
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
topic of discussion?

23
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I've been hired by Meredith Powell

24
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I see, uh…

26
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

27
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So it's nothing that official.

28
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I just have some basic questions
about Paul Allen,

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
- about yourself—
- Coffee?

30
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
No, I'm okay.

31
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
- Apollinaris?
- No, I'm okay.

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
[beeps]

33
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Can you bring Mr.—

34
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
- Kimball.
- Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollin—

35
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
- No, really, I'm okay.
- It's no problem.

36
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So, what's the topic of discussion?

37
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The disappearance of Paul Allen.

38
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Right.

39
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, I haven't—

40
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything,

41
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
not on Page Six at least.

42
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

43
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Understandable. Lime?

44
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
No, no, really, I'm okay.

45
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

46
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Just some preliminary questions
that I need for my own files, okay?

47
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Shoot.

48
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
- How old are you?
- 27.

49
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Where did you go to school?

50
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Harvard, then Harvard Business School.

51
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Your address?

52
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The American Gardens building,
West 81st Street.

53
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Nice. Very nice.

54
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Thanks.

55
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What can you tell me about Paul Allen?

56
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm at a loss.

57
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
He was part of that whole Yale thing.

58
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
- "Yale thing"?
- Yeah, Yale thing.

59
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
What do you mean, "Yale thing"?

60
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Well, I think for one that
he was probably a closet homosexual

61
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
who did a lot of cocaine.

62
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That "Yale thing."

63
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What kind of man was he?

64
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Besides the information
you've just given me.

65
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

66
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Do you feel like that?

67
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
No, not really.

68
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Where did Paul hang out?

69
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
- Hang out?
- Yeah, you know, hang out.

70
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Let me think.

71
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The Newport, Harry's,

72
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Flutie's, Indochine,

73
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

74
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the New York Yacht Club.

75
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He had a yacht?

76
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
No, he just hung out there.

77
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And where did he go to school?

78
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Don't you know this?

79
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I just wanted to know if you know.

80
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
Saint Paul's.

81
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Listen, I just—

82
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I just want to help.

83
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I understand.

84
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

85
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine

86
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that says he went to London.

87
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Maybe he did, huh?

88
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.
- But has anyone seen him in London?

89
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
- Actually, yes.
- Hmm.

90
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
But I've had a hard time
getting actual verification.

91
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
A Stephen Hughes said
he saw him at a restaurant there.

92
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But I checked it out and what happened is

93
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth
for Paul, so…

94
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Had his apartment been burglarized?

95
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
No, actually it hadn't.

96
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Toiletries were missing, a suit was gone,
so was some luggage. That's it.

97
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I mean, no one's dealing with
the homicide squad yet or anything, right?

98
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure.

99
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Basically,
no one's seen or heard anything.

100
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So typical, isn't it?

101
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's just strange.

102
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
One day someone's walking around,

103
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
going to work, alive, and then—

104
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Nothing.

105
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
People just disappear.

106
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The earth just opens up and swallows them.

107
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Eerie.

108
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Really eerie.

109
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Listen, you'll have to excuse me.

110
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable
at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

111
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The Four Seasons?

112
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Isn't that a little far uptown?

113
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I mean, aren't you going to be late?

114
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
No, there's one down here.

115
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
- Oh, really? I didn't know that.
- Yes. It's very good.

116
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Listen,

117
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
if anything else occurs to you,
any information—

118
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Absolutely. I'm 100% with you.

119
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Great, and…

120
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
thanks for your time, Mr. Bateman.

121
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
- Bye-bye.
- [Jean] Good-bye.
