00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.

00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.

00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice. 

00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.

00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.

00:00:33 --> 00:00:34
Once I have that, it's...

00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
Oink, oink.

00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
Shit.

00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
So that's where you keep the sugar.

00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
That sounds like hostility, doesn't it?

00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
No, we don't, John.

00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
I just had them polished.

00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
Go and put the kettle on.


00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
I'm sweet enough.
