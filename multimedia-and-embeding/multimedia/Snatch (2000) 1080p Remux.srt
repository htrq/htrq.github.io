1
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:13,971
<i>My name is Turkish.</i>

2
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:16,349
<i>Funny name for an Englishman, I know.</i>

3
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,978
<i>My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.</i>

4
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:23,606
<i>They named me after the plane.</i>

5
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:26,400
<i>Not many people are
named after a plane crash.</i>

6
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,611
<i>That's Tommy.</i>

7
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,030
<i>He tells people he was named after a gun.</i>

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,952
<i>But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th-century ballet dancer.</i>

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,580
<i>Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.</i>

10
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>Doesn't mean we hold hands or take walks.</i>

11
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:47,380
<i>It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.</i>

12
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:50,591
<i>I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.</i>

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,886
<i>But really, he's like my brother.</i>

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,640
<i>What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.</i>

15
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,769
<i>I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:</i>

16
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,605
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

17
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,941
<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

18
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,153
<i>- Himy, would you listen to this?
- Do we have a choice?</i>

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,865
<i>It wasn't meant to be taken literally.</i>

20
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:17,577
<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.</i>

21
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,162
<i>It's bound with moral fiber,</i>

22
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>but asking a grown man to believe it?</i>

23
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>What is it?</i>

24
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,840
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

25
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:35,469
<i>What you want I should do, drop my pants?</i>

26
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,430
<i>Okay, go through.</i>

27
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,891
<i>It's a nice story.</i>

28
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:44,520
<i>It's just that. Just a story.</i>

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,232
<i>Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.</i>

30
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,735
<i>Enough already.
Ruben, say something.</i>

31
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,738
<i>Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.</i>

32
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:58,200
<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"</i>

33
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,620
<i>into the Greek word for "virgin."</i>

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,289
<i>It was an easy mistake to make</i>

35
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:08,085
<i>because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.</i>

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>So, they came up with a prophecy:</i>

37
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,852
<i>"Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son."</i>

38
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,231
<i>You understand? It was "virgin"
that caught people's attention.</i>

39
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:33,611
<i>It's not every day a virgin conceives
and bears a son.</i>

40
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,964
<i>But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew,</i>

41
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:57,760
<i>and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.</i>

42
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,180
Oy vay, <i>what are you saying?</i>

43
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,974
<i>I'm saying, just because it's written</i>

44
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,768
<i>doesn't make it so.</i>

45
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:09,939
<i>Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.</i>

46
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,774
<i>- People like to believe.
- I don't want to hear any more.</i>

47
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:16,112
<i>Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?</i>

48
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,447
<i>- Michael.
- Hello?</i>

49
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,367
<i>Mutti.</i>

50
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:25,329
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,460
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

52
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:32,628
- Michael.
- Mutti.

53
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,633
You kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

54
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,307
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,894
Get on the floor!

56
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,439
Lie on the floor!

57
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:52,982
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,485
- Get down!
- Get fucking down!

59
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,946
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,573
On the ground!

61
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,579
Get down, I say!

62
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,873
- Time.
- Seven minutes!

63
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,211
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,592
Where is the stone?

65
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:23,763
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,103
Michael, where is the stone?

67
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,858
When does your plane leave?

68
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,110
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,445
Give me your gun.

70
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,959
When you get to London

71
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,086
if you want a gun...

72
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,130
call this number.

73
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,928
- Boris.
- Boris.

74
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:31,432
He can get you anything you need.

75
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,482
Is he allowed to do that?

76
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:44,987
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

77
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,346
These lads are out to hurt each other.

78
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,159
What's with those sausages, Charlie?

79
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,744
Two minutes, Turkish.

80
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:57,207
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

81
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,918
We'll need a proper office.

82
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,129
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

83
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,964
Why me?

84
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,592
Well, you know about caravans.

85
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,260
How's that?

86
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:11,972
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

87
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,517
And I don't wanna have me pants
pulled down over the price.

88
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,076
What's wrong with this one?

89
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,564
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

90
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,650
It's tiptop.

91
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,693
I'm just not sure about the color.

92
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,073
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

93
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:31,116
Here's an address.

94
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,286
It's a campsite.

95
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,874
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

96
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,836
- What's happening with the sausages?
- Five minutes.

97
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,675
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

98
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,510
They ain't pikeys, are they?

99
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,513
I fucking hate pikeys.

100
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:55,349
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

101
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,145
Fuck me. Hold tight.

102
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,232
- What's that?
- It's me belt.

103
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,818
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

104
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,238
- What's a gun doing in your trousers?
- It's for protection.

105
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,656
Protection from what?

106
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:12,741
"Zee" Germans?

107
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,161
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?

108
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,623
- Where did you get it?
- Boris The Blade.

109
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,376
You mean Boris the sneaky
fucking Russian.

110
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,628
Heavy, isn't it?

111
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,423
Heavy is good.

112
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,009
Heavy is reliable.

113
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,886
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

114
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:36,223
<i>Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.</i>

115
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:39,810
<i>Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.</i>

116
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:44,732
<i>Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.</i>

117
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,027
<i>Back to my partner, Tommy.</i>

118
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,903
<i>Tommy runs the other business</i>

119
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,989
<i>the slot machines</i>

120
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,784
<i>which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.</i>

121
00:08:55,951 --> 00:09:00,456
<i>However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.</i>

122
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:02,833
All right, I'll take it.

123
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,004
<i>There's a reason for Tommy's
newfound enthusiasm for firearms.</i>

124
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:11,800
<i>Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:</i>

125
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,218
<i>Brick Top.</i>

126
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,138
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

127
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,475
- He doesn't look bad, does he?
- No, he looks great.

128
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,101
He'll do you proud.

129
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,481
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

130
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:26,747
It's what you deserve.

131
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,359
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

132
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:31,653
Dogs do that.

133
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,156
You're not a dog, are you?

134
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,824
No. No, I'm not.

135
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,493
However...

136
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,997
you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

137
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,499
All except loyalty.

138
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:48,170
<i>It's rumored that his favorite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun</i>

139
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:52,549
<i>a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.</i>

140
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,179
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

141
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:02,184
But I got no time for grouses.

142
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,355
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

143
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,067
What the fuck are you two looking at?

144
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,366
<i>If you got to deal with him, just make
sure you don't end up owing him.</i>

145
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,784
<i>Then you're in his debt.</i>

146
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>Which means, you're in his pocket.</i>

147
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,873
<i>And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.</i>

148
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,627
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.

149
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,088
I'll be doing you a favor, boy.

150
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:34,341
<i>What he means is, I'm doing him a favor.</i>

151
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:39,596
<i>Because everybody knows nobody
takes a dive in my fights. Unlike his.</i>

152
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,516
Here, Errol, I don't think he likes me.

153
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,601
You don't like me, do you?

154
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,061
Don't know what you mean.

155
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,523
<i>I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.</i>

156
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:54,987
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

157
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,447
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

158
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,242
<i>You can sort me out by showing me out.</i>

159
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,287
<i>It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then</i>

160
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:06,081
<i>you do something against your principles.</i>

161
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:09,334
<i>Basically, you have to forget
you got any.</i>

162
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,003
Are they Lancashire pigs?

163
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,796
Who's talking to you?

164
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,425
<i>Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.</i>

165
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,844
Don't let me down.

166
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:22,431
You don't want to let me down, do you?

167
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,602
See you ringside.

168
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:33,442
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers

169
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,320
has a diamond the size of a fist.

170
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,199
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

171
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,659
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

172
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,704
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

173
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:48,332
But don't you hit him either.

174
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,668
Americans can't know it was Russian.

175
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,587
It will come back to me.

176
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:55,589
So, what should I do?

177
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:57,758
You're my brother, so think like it.

178
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,054
Get somebody else to steal that stone!

179
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,389
I don't want it getting back to me.

180
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:07,517
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

181
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,519
So don't use idiots for the job.

182
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,398
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York,

183
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,068
so move quick. Okay?

184
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:19,529
It's okay.
I know a couple of guys.

185
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,365
One more thing.

186
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,158
It might help.

187
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,327
He loves to gamble.

188
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,872
Eighty-six karats?

189
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,083
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

190
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,336
A beautiful stone.

191
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:35,753
<i>You're a good boy, Franky.</i>

192
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:38,966
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

193
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:44,012
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

194
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,848
- Talk to my cousin Dougie.
- Doug The Head?

195
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,603
And Franky...

196
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,356
- And what?
<i>- Stay out of those casinos.</i>

197
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,403
<i>You did a good job, bubbe.</i>

198
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:02,698
- Don't go screwing it up, all right?
<i>- I hear you, Avi.</i>

199
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:05,325
I'll see you, Avi.

200
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,830
Eighty-six karats.

201
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:11,748
- Where?
- London.

202
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,583
- London?
- London.

203
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,794
- London?
- Yes, London.

204
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,381
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea

205
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:22,801
bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

206
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,804
Not for me.

207
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,182
<i>That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.</i>

208
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:32,268
<i>If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.</i>

209
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:35,355
<i>Pretends he's Jewish.
Wishes he was Jewish.</i>

210
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,816
<i>Even tells his family they're Jewish,</i>

211
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,320
<i>but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.</i>

212
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,532
<i>He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business</i>

213
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,160
<i>- it is good for business.</i>
- Avi!

214
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:50,412
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

215
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,373
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

216
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,209
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

217
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:58,587
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

218
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,630
<i>We play by the rules.</i>

219
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:02,215
Listen to me.

220
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,761
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

221
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:09,931
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

222
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,397
What are you doing here?

223
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,524
It's a free country, isn't it?

224
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,611
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?

225
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,738
So fuck off.

226
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,001
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

227
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,379
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

228
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:43,340
- You got to go see him.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

229
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,927
- He's a big mucker in New York.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

230
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,638
I want to see you girls up in my office.

231
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:52,349
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

232
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,440
The weight is sign of reliability.

233
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,276
I always go for reliability.

234
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,120
I'll take it.

235
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,955
How much do you want for it?

236
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:16,373
Nothing.

237
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:21,211
Okay, so what do you want for it?

238
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,120
I want you to do something for me.

239
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,967
There is a fight in couple of days.

240
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:29,761
What kind of a fight?

241
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,680
Unlicensed boxing.

242
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:36,059
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

243
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:40,856
If you place one down for me...

244
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:42,983
we will call it quits.

245
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,527
- Why don't you put it down yourself?
- Well...

246
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:51,199
there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

247
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,579
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

248
00:15:57,747 --> 00:16:00,375
I know something most don't.

249
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,711
So, <i>nu</i>?

250
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,422
What do you know?

251
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:12,929
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

252
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,183
- Ten points.
- What are we doing here?

253
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:20,270
- We're buying a caravan.
- Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

254
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,190
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

255
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:24,483
Not if you're here.

256
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,526
Oh, you bastard.

257
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,321
I fucking hate pikeys.

258
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,783
That's a flash car, mister.

259
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,452
Not as flash as your bike.

260
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,621
Who are you looking for?

261
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,164
Mr. O'Neil.

262
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,083
- Want me to get him?
- That's a good lad.

263
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,085
Piss off.

264
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,631
- Are you going to go get him for me?
- Yeah.

265
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,676
- What are you waiting for?
- The five quid you'll pay me.

266
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,512
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

267
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,097
- Two fifty.
- You can have a quid.

268
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,933
You're a real tight fucker.

269
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,018
<i>There was a problem with gypsies.</i>

270
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,228
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

271
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,262
<i>You can't understand what's being said.</i>

272
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,089
You Tommy?
Come about the caravan?

273
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:08,527
- Mr. O'Neil.
- Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

274
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:10,362
<i>Not Irish, not English.</i>

275
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,822
- How are you?
- Weather's been kind.

276
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,783
<i>It's just Pikey.</i>

277
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,234
Would you look at the size of him?

278
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:19,246
How big are you?

279
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:21,414
- Kids, how big is he?
- Big, for sure.

280
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,376
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

281
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:29,839
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

282
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,676
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

283
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,261
I could murder one.

284
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:37,514
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

285
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,766
Get your hands out of there.

286
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,643
Cup of tea for the big fella?

287
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,980
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

288
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,691
You little bugger.

289
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:51,111
- Is the big fella not coming with us?
- He's minding the car.

290
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,156
- What does he think we are, thieves?
- No, nothing like that.

291
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:58,573
- He just likes looking after cars.
- Good dags. Do you like dags?

292
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,537
- Dags?
- What?

293
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,537
- Yeah, dags.
- Dags. You like dags?

294
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,749
Oh, dogs.

295
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,085
Sure, I like dags.

296
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,130
- I like caravans more.
- You're very welcome.

297
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,769
<i>Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.</i>

298
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,022
<i>It's probably why they talk like that,</i>

299
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,399
<i>so you can't follow what's being said.</i>

300
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,111
<i>But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked</i>

301
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,697
<i>on his return there will be ice cream.</i>

302
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:38,241
Good dog, good family.

303
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,202
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

304
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:44,331
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

305
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,750
All right, Mickey. Laters.

306
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,793
I don't see what the fuss is about.

307
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,713
They aren't bad fellas.

308
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,142
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

309
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,479
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

310
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,564
See that car? Use it.

311
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,443
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

312
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,655
Nobody brings you

313
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,783
unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

314
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,703
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

315
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:26,956
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

316
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,335
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Over my dead body.

317
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:31,920
Now, go on! Go on!

318
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,132
I'll not have you fighting! You know
what happens when you fight!

319
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,134
Get her to sit down.

320
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:40,470
For fuck's sake!

321
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:48,395
Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.

322
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:51,189
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

323
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:06,538
So that's the kind of fight it'll be.

324
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,957
You want to stay down.

325
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,422
You want to stay down!

326
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,969
Get back down and fucking stay down.

327
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,638
I promise you, you want to stay down.

328
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,997
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

329
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,226
Cheeky bastard.

330
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,985
- Okay, lads.
- Get him on his feet.

331
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,529
Get back down,

332
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:42,574
or you will not be coming up next time.

333
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,995
Bollocks to you.

334
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,456
This is sick. I'm out of here.

335
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:52,208
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

336
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,464
You stay until the job's done.

337
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,209
<i>It turned out that the sweet. Talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey</i>

338
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,212
<i>was a gypsy bare. Knuckle
boxing champion.</i>

339
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,173
<i>Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.</i>

340
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,719
<i>Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.</i>

341
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,639
<i>If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes</i>

342
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,141
<i>Tommy knows he'll be buried with him.</i>

343
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,436
<i>Why would the gypsies want to explain</i>

344
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:55,897
<i>why a man died in their campsite?</i>

345
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:59,317
<i>Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.</i>

346
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,071
<i>It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?</i>

347
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:05,657
<i>Tommy, "The Tit"</i>

348
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:07,575
<i>is praying.</i>

349
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,077
<i>And if he isn't</i>

350
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,371
<i>he fucking should be.</i>

351
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:40,358
Bad Boy.

352
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,610
- Sol.
- Easy.

353
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,613
No, it's a moissanite.

354
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,781
A what?

355
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:50,451
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

356
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:51,744
It's Mickey Mouse.

357
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,746
Spurious.

358
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:55,957
Not genuine.

359
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,126
And it's worth...

360
00:22:58,626 --> 00:22:59,627
fuck-all.

361
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,922
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

362
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,966
Leave this game to me and Sol.

363
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,635
Laters.

364
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,557
What is that, Vince?

365
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:14,475
This is a dog, Sol.

366
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,936
You are not bringing that thing in here.

367
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,813
It's only a fucking dog.

368
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,731
- Where'd you get it?
- The gyppos.

369
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:21,983
Here.

370
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,334
They threw it in with the moody gold.

371
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,991
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

372
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,618
It better not be dangerous.

373
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,622
What do you think you're doing now?

374
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,875
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

375
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,503
Stop the dog!

376
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,922
Come back!

377
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:46,007
All right, Boris?

378
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:50,011
- Don't worry about the dog.
- I'm not.

379
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,889
What can I do for you?

380
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,391
I have a job for you.

381
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,352
I already have a job.

382
00:23:58,227 --> 00:24:01,064
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

383
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,441
Go on.

384
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,986
I want you to hold up a bookies.

385
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,534
From Russia with love, eh?

386
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,663
I have stones to sell

387
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:19,999
fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks,

388
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,808
so if I am not rushing you...

389
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,838
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

390
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,384
I am not in Rome, Doug.

391
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,344
I am in a rush.

392
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,221
I got to make the bookies.

393
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,555
Bookies?

394
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,907
- What are you betting on?
- Bomber Harris.

395
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:41,062
The unlicensed boxer?

396
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,817
Do you know something that I don't?

397
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:50,989
Bubbe, I probably know a lot you don't.

398
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:54,909
He's bad to the bone, ain't you, Tyrone?

399
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,369
Of course I am.

400
00:24:56,577 --> 00:25:00,415
Tyrone will drive for us.
He's done a rally driving course.

401
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:01,874
Of course I have.

402
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:07,463
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

403
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,215
Your seats?

404
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,718
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

405
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,886
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car,

406
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:18,516
so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

407
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,644
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

408
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,604
It went back to the gyppos.

409
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,566
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

410
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,069
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

411
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,946
Ask him.

412
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,939
It's like he's a fucking homing beacon.

413
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,994
Steady on the brakes.

414
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,653
I thought you said he could drive, Sol.

415
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:44,584
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

416
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,294
All right?

417
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:08,107
What?

418
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:12,195
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

419
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:15,281
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

420
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,075
Worry about getting us a gun.

421
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,456
What's that?

422
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,959
This is a shotgun, Sol.

423
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,004
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

424
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:34,258
- I want to raise pulses, don't I?
- You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

425
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,946
That does not look like a bookies.

426
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:59,408
Why'd we stop here? What's the matter
with that space over there?

427
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,577
It's too tight.

428
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,704
Too tight?

429
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,833
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

430
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:11,295
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

431
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,172
Of course I am.

432
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,311
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

433
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:29,647
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

434
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,650
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

435
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,319
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

436
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,197
People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

437
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,448
I didn't see it.

438
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:43,619
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

439
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,538
It was at a funny angle.

440
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,584
It's behind you, Tyrone.

441
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:52,253
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

442
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,214
Control that dog as well.

443
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:58,259
- Get that dog off him.
- Get it off me.

444
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:03,097
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

445
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:07,977
Don't snatch.

446
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:11,856
He can't swallow the whole ball.

447
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,902
Yeah.

448
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,448
Why the fuck

449
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,075
did you put Gorgeous George

450
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,953
into a bare-knuckle boxing match

451
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,497
two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

452
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:32,043
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

453
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:36,505
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

454
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,133
What the fuck did you expect?

455
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:41,719
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

456
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,388
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

457
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,099
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

458
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,726
You did.

459
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:52,979
You said get a good deal.

460
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:55,650
I fail to recognize the correlation

461
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:59,070
between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous,

462
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,613
and a good deal.

463
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:02,990
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

464
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:05,117
That his fight won't happen?

465
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:07,036
We replace the fighter.

466
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,121
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

467
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,249
Who the fuck will we replace him with?

468
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:13,251
What about John The Gun?

469
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,962
Or Mad Fist Willy?

470
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:18,422
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

471
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:20,675
Mad Fist went mad,

472
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,594
and The Gun shot himself.

473
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,809
Jesus.

474
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:36,899
- What?
- Let's use the fucking pikey.

475
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,695
- How much you gonna pay us?
- 10K.

476
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:44,240
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

477
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:53,582
All right.

478
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,794
I'll do it for a caravan.

479
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,546
A what?

480
00:29:58,754 --> 00:29:59,964
A caravan.

481
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:03,801
- Top of the range and all that.
- It was us that wanted a caravan.

482
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,470
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

483
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,889
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

484
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,726
Your what?

485
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:13,144
His ma.

486
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,757
<i>Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.</i>

487
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:46,469
<i>They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.</i>

488
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,095
<i>Now I'm changing fighters...</i>

489
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:51,807
<i>and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.</i>

490
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:54,685
<i>He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up,</i>

491
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:57,271
<i>and aim for penetration.</i>

492
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,648
<i>If I didn't have the replacement pikey</i>

493
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,193
<i>he'd want to split me in half.</i>

494
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:08,446
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

495
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,709
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

496
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,797
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

497
00:31:22,963 --> 00:31:25,549
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

498
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,386
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

499
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,472
We've lost Gorgeous George.

500
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,478
You're gonna have to repeat that.

501
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,648
We've lost Gorgeous George.

502
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:43,025
Well, where'd you lose him?

503
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,820
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

504
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:48,823
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?

505
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:50,089
We're not backing out.

506
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,160
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

507
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:54,829
We're changing the fighter.

508
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,667
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

509
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,086
Who are you changing him to, sweetheart?

510
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:04,672
You won't know him, but he's mustard.

511
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,090
Mustard?

512
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,927
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee

513
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:11,627
you can't change fighters.

514
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,014
- You've still got your fight.
- No.

515
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:17,435
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

516
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:21,522
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

517
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,482
You can take bets at the fight.

518
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:26,441
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

519
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,946
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?

520
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,996
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

521
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:40,583
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

522
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,378
<i>This is the one place
I didn't want to be:</i>

523
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,880
<i>In his debt.</i>

524
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,716
<i>Which now means I'm in his pocket.</i>

525
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,802
You're on thin fucking ice,
my pedigree chums.

526
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,722
And I shall be under it when it breaks.

527
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:57,224
Now, fuck off.

528
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:08,736
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

529
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,114
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

530
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,950
- When later?
- He said he wanted cash.

531
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:18,245
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

532
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,170
A fight?

533
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,758
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

534
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:35,638
- Is there gambling involved?
- It's a boxing match, Avi.

535
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:38,432
- Did he have a case with him?
- Yes, he had a case.

536
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,351
And this schmuck is gambling?

537
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:45,272
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

538
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,107
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

539
00:33:47,274 --> 00:33:49,443
You're plenty stupid, I'll give you that.

540
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,279
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

541
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,864
I have no idea.

542
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:57,284
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

543
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,995
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

544
00:34:00,162 --> 00:34:02,462
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

545
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,041
I'm sure he can pay.

546
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:08,045
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

547
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,631
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

548
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,389
- Avi!
- Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

549
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:23,227
I don't like leaving my own country

550
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:27,648
especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches,

551
00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:30,401
and cocktails with little straw hats.

552
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:32,945
We've got sandy beaches.

553
00:34:33,153 --> 00:34:35,030
So who the fuck wants to see them?

554
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,201
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

555
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,745
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

556
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,998
And we'll start at that fight.

557
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,002
How am I gonna get it out?

558
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:50,004
It will probably cough it up.

559
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,505
Will he be all right?

560
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,007
I hope not.

561
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:56,468
- Are we gonna rob this bookies?
- Yes, big man.

562
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:57,845
Why are we waiting?

563
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,557
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

564
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,725
And why's that?

565
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:07,855
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

566
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:09,565
What's in the case?

567
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:14,069
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

568
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:16,864
Jesus.

569
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,367
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- I'm well aware of that, my son.

570
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:22,286
That's why we're here.

571
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,289
Well done. This is the back way in.

572
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:28,542
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

573
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,618
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- We know. That's why we're here.

574
00:35:33,255 --> 00:35:34,381
Tickets.

575
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,051
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

576
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:40,137
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

577
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:43,223
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

578
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,310
I'm not looking for Vegas or for legal.

579
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,395
I'm looking for Franky.

580
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:52,066
I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.

581
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:55,318
- If there's gambling, he'll be here.
- Let's not have a fuck-up.

582
00:35:55,402 --> 00:35:56,737
You won't let us down.

583
00:35:56,987 --> 00:36:00,908
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.

584
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,746
Is that him?

585
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:08,082
I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?

586
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:10,542
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

587
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,420
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.

588
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:31,521
Do you know who this bookies belongs to?

589
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:34,555
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything...

590
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:41,615
What are you doing?

591
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,284
What does it look like I'm doing up here?

592
00:36:46,453 --> 00:36:49,331
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

593
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:51,834
Drop the screen now.

594
00:36:55,003 --> 00:36:56,255
How you doing, Vince?

595
00:36:56,463 --> 00:36:58,882
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

596
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,135
- Fill that bag.
- All bets are off.

597
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:05,139
I am not in here to make a fucking bet.

598
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:06,557
Appreciated,

599
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:08,684
but all bets...

600
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:11,645
are

601
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,021
off.

602
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:17,401
If all bets are off, there can't be
any money, can there?

603
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,280
I ain't fucking buying that.

604
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,992
That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

605
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,369
What have you got?

606
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,748
Nothing, really.

607
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,334
A few coins, but no notes.

608
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,172
Show me your hands.

609
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,009
You've got five fingers.

610
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:46,346
Copper coins.

611
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,225
What do you mean, copper fucking coins?

612
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:02,863
It won't open
because it's a security door.

613
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,198
Hold that.

614
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,666
My leg.

615
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:21,131
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

616
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,058
We're fucked.

617
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,442
What the fuck are you two doing?

618
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:45,989
Get us out of here.

619
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,623
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

620
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:05,092
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

621
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,723
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

622
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:15,435
In the red corner

623
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:18,188
we have the young and unchallenged...

624
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:22,693
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

625
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,685
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

626
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,699
So give it up for the bone-crunching

627
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,076
one-punch machine gun

628
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,203
Mickey!

629
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:41,628
And in the other corner...

630
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:43,922
Now, I know he looks like a fat fucker...

631
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,081
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

632
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:52,139
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

633
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:56,935
Now, try and look like a fighter.

634
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,646
Let's get ready

635
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:01,982
to rumble!

636
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:39,227
Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?

637
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:40,686
What's the fucking crack?

638
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:43,565
- I'll make it up to you.
- I ain't happy.

639
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:47,235
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

640
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:50,572
Oh, that fucking pikey's put me in it.

641
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,451
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

642
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,621
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone

643
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,831
I don't want to know if it tastes good.

644
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:04,711
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking Jacobs off.

645
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,361
- He's here.
- Well, you explain it to him.

646
00:41:36,576 --> 00:41:39,287
- What you doing?
- The case was attached to his arm.

647
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:41,915
So why didn't you chop it off?

648
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,418
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

649
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,044
But he has the case.

650
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,922
Look, we... Well, you have a problem.

651
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,426
There weren't much cash at the bookies.

652
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:54,553
Okay.

653
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,431
Here is the 10 grand.

654
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,726
No. Keep it. We want this.

655
00:42:00,892 --> 00:42:03,562
Well, at least half of this.

656
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:06,606
What was in the case was mine.

657
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:10,152
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

658
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:14,281
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

659
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:16,366
No, I'm afraid it's too late for that.

660
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,995
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

661
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:24,416
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

662
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,343
Watch out!

663
00:42:37,804 --> 00:42:39,514
Drop the gun, fat boy.

664
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:47,105
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

665
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,858
Give me the stone.

666
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:53,445
- It's in the case.
- What?

667
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:55,822
It's in the case.

668
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,699
You put the stone in the case?

669
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:00,702
Open it and give me the stone.

670
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:05,957
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

671
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:39,366
<i>Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.</i>

672
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:44,621
<i>Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.</i>

673
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,500
<i>I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

674
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:53,380
<i>I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.</i>

675
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,384
<i>But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.</i>

676
00:43:57,592 --> 00:43:59,386
<i>Once I have that, it's...</i>

677
00:43:59,594 --> 00:44:00,720
Oink, oink.

678
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,556
Shit.

679
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,685
So that's where you keep the sugar.

680
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,565
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

681
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,058
That sounds like hostility, doesn't it?

682
00:44:15,193 --> 00:44:17,529
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

683
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,865
No, we don't, John.

684
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,296
I just had them polished.

685
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:41,428
Go and put the kettle on.

686
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,268
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

687
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:50,937
I'm sweet enough.

688
00:44:59,654 --> 00:45:01,740
He is now your problem.

689
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,409
Okay?

690
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:16,630
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body,

691
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:20,091
but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

692
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,638
Well, look at him.

693
00:45:31,811 --> 00:45:34,856
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

694
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,441
I want to use the pikey.

695
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:39,402
All right. Of course.

696
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,863
Of course, fucking of course.

697
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:44,616
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

698
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,785
But this time...

699
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:51,414
I do want him to go down in the fourth.

700
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:56,378
And I do mean it, this time.

701
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:09,641
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

702
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,604
So now you can open it.

703
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,274
Turkish has been a busy little bastard.

704
00:46:17,482 --> 00:46:19,276
I think he's got away with enough.

705
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:23,571
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

706
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,740
That takes care of one little piggy.

707
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,827
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

708
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,328
Find them today.

709
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:51,808
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

710
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,727
Tommy.

711
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,273
You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?

712
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:00,775
You're looking for my boy, are you?

713
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,486
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Yeah.

714
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,788
Would you like to share that information?

715
00:47:06,948 --> 00:47:09,367
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.

716
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,872
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

717
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:16,833
He's coursing.

718
00:47:19,085 --> 00:47:20,920
What's coursing?

719
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,130
Hare coursing.

720
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:26,926
They set two lurchers...
They're dogs, before you ask.

721
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,387
On a hare.

722
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,099
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

723
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,393
So, what if it doesn't?

724
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:40,231
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

725
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,445
Proper fucked?

726
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,489
Yeah, Tommy.

727
00:47:47,822 --> 00:47:50,075
Before "zee" Germans get there.

728
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:54,120
Do you know these tits, Errol?

729
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,789
I know a lot of tits,

730
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:58,958
but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

731
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,377
John?

732
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,879
I can't help, guv.

733
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:09,052
Tyrone.

734
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,138
You silly, fat bastard.

735
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,540
- Do you want to do it?
- That depends.

736
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,643
On what?

737
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,771
On you buying this caravan.

738
00:48:19,979 --> 00:48:22,399
Not the rouge one. The rose.

739
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,234
- It's not the same caravan.
- Not the same fight.

740
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:27,320
It's twice the size of the last one.

741
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,573
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

742
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,785
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

743
00:48:33,993 --> 00:48:38,081
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

744
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,543
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

745
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,424
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

746
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:49,968
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

747
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:02,105
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

748
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:05,817
Have I made myself clear?

749
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,238
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

750
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,783
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

751
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,665
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

752
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:24,794
I'll tell you what.

753
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,672
Fucker.

754
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,757
I'll bet you for it.

755
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,301
You'll what?

756
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:32,886
He'll bet you for it.

757
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:36,347
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favor?

758
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,057
I'll do you a favor.

759
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,977
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan,

760
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,313
and the boys get a pair of them shoes.

761
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:47,192
If I lose...

762
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,405
fuck it, I'll do the fight for free.

763
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,202
<i>The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.</i>

764
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,660
<i>However, I don't really
have much of a choice.</i>

765
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:03,458
<i>Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose...</i>

766
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:06,920
<i>Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.</i>

767
00:50:07,378 --> 00:50:11,049
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

768
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:13,259
What? Proper fucked?

769
00:50:15,553 --> 00:50:17,222
You got that, London?

770
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,473
We're on!

771
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,590
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

772
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:36,073
I'll tell you who robbed your bookies.

773
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:55,695
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

774
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,074
Who's proper fucked now, then?

775
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,870
There's something very wrong with this.

776
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,373
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

777
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:12,754
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap
in his ass" then, Tommy?

778
00:52:13,254 --> 00:52:16,507
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

779
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,218
What? You saying I can't shoot?

780
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:23,014
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

781
00:52:23,264 --> 00:52:25,099
I know you can't shoot.

782
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,520
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers

783
00:52:29,687 --> 00:52:31,898
would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

784
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:33,650
You saying the gun don't work?

785
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,234
You tried it?

786
00:52:40,531 --> 00:52:41,532
Whoops.

787
00:52:43,993 --> 00:52:47,080
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

788
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,081
Why's he got a tea cozy on his head?

789
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,041
Why's he got a tea cozy on his head?

790
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,168
To keep his head warm.

791
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,879
- What happened to him?
- He got shot in the face.

792
00:52:55,129 --> 00:52:56,589
I thought that was obvious.

793
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,300
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

794
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,844
- What do you want me to do?
- Sort it out.

795
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,931
- I'm not a witch doctor.
- But you are a bad boy yardie,

796
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:08,089
and bad boy yardies should
know how to get rid of bodies.

797
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,020
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

798
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,153
We're in, governor.

799
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,949
Goody gumdrops.

800
00:53:23,157 --> 00:53:25,535
Get us a cup of tea, would you, Errol?

801
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,512
Grab hold of his legs.

802
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,582
What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?

803
00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:44,679
Hope this is not a bad moment.

804
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,977
Do you know who I am?

805
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:54,814
I do.

806
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,824
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

807
00:54:06,492 --> 00:54:08,035
Well, I don't.

808
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:20,256
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

809
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,717
Apparently, the best thing to do

810
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:27,597
is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

811
00:54:28,514 --> 00:54:31,142
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

812
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,395
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

813
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,107
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.

814
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,450
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

815
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:51,120
You gotta starve the pigs for a few days

816
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,582
then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

817
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,629
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out,

818
00:54:59,837 --> 00:55:01,380
for the piggies' digestion.

819
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,883
You could do this afterwards, of course,

820
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,750
but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

821
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:11,557
They will go through bone like butter.

822
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,853
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting,

823
00:55:16,103 --> 00:55:20,107
so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

824
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,528
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds

825
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,696
in about eight minutes.

826
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,573
That means that a single pig

827
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:31,494
can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh

828
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:33,871
every minute.

829
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,332
Hence the expression

830
00:55:36,582 --> 00:55:39,919
"as greedy as a pig."

831
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:48,010
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

832
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,430
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are

833
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,600
apart from someone who feeds
people to pigs, of course.

834
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,773
Do you know what "nemesis" means?

835
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:08,573
"A righteous infliction of retribution

836
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:12,493
manifested by an
appropriate agent."

837
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:17,623
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

838
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:19,625
Me.

839
00:56:27,466 --> 00:56:28,801
Gentlemen...

840
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,501
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

841
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:07,548
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

842
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:10,343
What about Tony?

843
00:57:10,509 --> 00:57:11,802
<i>Bullet-Tooth Tony.</i>

844
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:13,053
Who's Bullet-Tooth...?

845
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:15,264
- Tony!
- You silly fuck.

846
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,515
He's a liability.

847
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:18,935
He'd find Moses and the burning bush.

848
00:57:19,143 --> 00:57:20,603
You are gonna die, Tony!

849
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:24,106
He got shot six times,
had the bullets molded into gold.

850
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,692
I shoot you, you go down!

851
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:29,737
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

852
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,657
Why don't you fucking die?

853
00:57:32,823 --> 00:57:35,576
- He's the best chance you got.
- Six times?

854
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,537
In one sitting.

855
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:41,082
You're in trouble now.

856
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,961
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

857
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,557
<i>Bonjour.</i>

858
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,397
What's so fucking important?

859
00:58:04,605 --> 00:58:06,857
Why do you think we've got a dead man

860
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,902
- missing an arm in our office?
- Talk to me, tell me.

861
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,904
You give us four days

862
00:58:12,196 --> 00:58:15,825
I'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

863
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,243
What do you think, Errol?

864
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,746
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

865
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,207
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

866
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:26,085
What have I told you about thinking?

867
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,879
- You got 48 hours.
- Yeah.

868
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:32,425
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

869
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:33,884
Forty-eight hours.

870
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:35,676
After that it's your family,

871
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,681
and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

872
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:45,062
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

873
00:58:45,229 --> 00:58:47,022
Call me "Susan" if it makes you happy.

874
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,609
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

875
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,530
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

876
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:55,823
Forty thousand.

877
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:00,327
Where was he last seen?

878
00:59:01,203 --> 00:59:02,204
At a bookies.

879
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,123
Bookies?

880
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,252
Pass us the blower, Susi.

881
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:15,384
- Bookies got blagged last night.
- Blagged? Speak English.

882
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:20,347
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

883
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,974
Blagged, robbed.

884
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:24,560
We'll see a man that may know something.

885
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,562
I need a gun.

886
00:59:26,812 --> 00:59:29,899
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

887
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:34,779
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

888
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,114
He's stained for fucking life.

889
00:59:37,364 --> 00:59:40,076
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell...

890
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:41,660
All right, Mullet?

891
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,375
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

892
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,503
Nice tie.

893
00:59:50,669 --> 00:59:52,469
I heard you weren't about that much.

894
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,883
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

895
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,302
Unlike yours, Mullet.

896
00:59:59,011 --> 01:00:00,638
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

897
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:04,183
- Do me a favor, Tone.
- I will do you a favor, Mullet.

898
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:08,187
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

899
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:12,650
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

900
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:18,531
Comfortable, Mullet?

901
01:00:18,864 --> 01:00:21,950
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

902
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,870
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

903
01:00:25,287 --> 01:00:27,164
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

904
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:30,000
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

905
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:34,255
- What you think I'm doing?
- Well, don't, Tone.

906
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,341
You been using dog shit for toothpaste?

907
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,843
Slow down, Tone.

908
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,178
Slow down, Tony!

909
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,973
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

910
01:00:45,432 --> 01:00:47,518
Play some music if you like.

911
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,771
I love this track.

912
01:00:52,022 --> 01:00:54,650
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

913
01:00:55,192 --> 01:00:56,360
Yes, Mullet?

914
01:00:56,652 --> 01:01:01,866
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawnshop in Smith Street.

915
01:01:02,032 --> 01:01:03,909
Better not be telling me porky pies.

916
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:09,707
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

917
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:12,334
It's very effective, Tony.

918
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,628
It's not too subtle, but effective.

919
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,673
Are we taking him with us?

920
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,100
<i>It's the Russian.</i>

921
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,269
A Russian?

922
01:01:30,477 --> 01:01:33,105
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

923
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:37,902
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

924
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:40,404
- Give me a name.
- Yurinov.

925
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:42,031
Boris.

926
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:44,116
- Boris The Blade?
- Yeah.

927
01:01:44,366 --> 01:01:47,244
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

928
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:51,207
Why do they call him The Bullet-Dodger?

929
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:54,543
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

930
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,423
<i>He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan,</i>

931
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,290
<i>and you nicked all our savings.</i>

932
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,763
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

933
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,601
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

934
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:13,187
- Are you taking the piss?
<i>- What can I do?</i>

935
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:15,606
I can't make him do it, can I?

936
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:18,984
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

937
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:28,035
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

938
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,622
I want that pikey to fight.

939
01:02:56,146 --> 01:02:59,316
<i>Brick Top thought smashing up our arcade</i>

940
01:02:59,566 --> 01:03:02,611
<i>might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.</i>

941
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:05,572
<i>And if that wasn't enough</i>

942
01:03:05,739 --> 01:03:08,742
<i>he thought it would be a good idea</i>

943
01:03:08,909 --> 01:03:11,495
<i>to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.</i>

944
01:03:12,913 --> 01:03:14,707
<i>While she was asleep in it.</i>

945
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,016
Turkish, get your arse up.

946
01:04:14,558 --> 01:04:15,559
You lot...

947
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:18,771
follow me and I'll fucking shoot you.

948
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:22,691
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

949
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:26,904
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

950
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,614
What?

951
01:04:28,947 --> 01:04:31,742
You want to see if I've got the minerals?

952
01:04:50,302 --> 01:04:51,678
Jesus.

953
01:04:51,845 --> 01:04:53,514
Sorry, Mickey.

954
01:04:54,556 --> 01:04:56,225
Did you do it?

955
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,815
Then what are you sorry for?

956
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,527
- What are you two doing here?
- Come back!

957
01:05:06,735 --> 01:05:09,613
- You got some tars on you.
- Fuck off, Darren.

958
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,907
Fuck off!

959
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:20,999
<i>How silly do I feel?</i>

960
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:24,211
<i>His mum is still smoking next to us,</i>

961
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,505
<i>and I'm asking him to fight.</i>

962
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,592
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

963
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,928
<i>And if he'd said no</i>

964
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,514
<i>it could've been a shite sight worse.</i>

965
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,105
Russians.

966
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:49,987
Russians.

967
01:05:50,195 --> 01:05:51,697
I should've known.

968
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:55,826
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

969
01:05:56,034 --> 01:05:58,120
What do you know about this goyim?

970
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,372
Ex-KGB cancer.

971
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,333
He was a highly trained undercover agent.

972
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,794
He'll be impossible to track down.

973
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:07,838
Yeah.

974
01:06:08,046 --> 01:06:11,467
<i>There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84.karat stone.</i>

975
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:14,219
- Where's he from?
<i>- I don't know. Hard to tell.</i>

976
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:16,013
<i>He's got a thick Russian accent.</i>

977
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:33,030
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

978
01:06:33,697 --> 01:06:36,783
That sneaky Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

979
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:39,912
First things first. One of us

980
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:45,042
Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

981
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:46,710
Now.

982
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,844
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

983
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:59,556
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

984
01:06:59,723 --> 01:07:01,433
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

985
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:04,269
Not a problem.

986
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,731
Get me to a doctor.

987
01:07:07,981 --> 01:07:10,776
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

988
01:07:11,026 --> 01:07:12,945
Okay, but first we get the stone.

989
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,364
First the stone. Then a doctor.

990
01:07:15,572 --> 01:07:18,450
And not just any doctor, <i>boychik.</i>
A nice Jewish doctor.

991
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,786
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

992
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:27,543
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

993
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:32,214
- I think you got something to tell us.
- Take it easy, Rosebud.

994
01:07:32,422 --> 01:07:34,716
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

995
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,344
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

996
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:41,223
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

997
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:44,101
I've got extra loud blanks, just in case.

998
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:47,980
In case we have to deafen them to death?

999
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,737
- Yeah.
- Boris is here.

1000
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:59,074
- We're coming over. Hold him there.
<i>- Hold on!</i>

1001
01:07:59,324 --> 01:08:00,409
He's not on his own!

1002
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:07,874
We're off.

1003
01:08:12,462 --> 01:08:15,007
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1004
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:26,059
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1005
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:30,772
So, where is he?

1006
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,692
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

1007
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,909
- They locked Boris in the car.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

1008
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:39,698
Did they look hard?

1009
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,199
They looked messy.

1010
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:44,202
- Let's get out of here.
- What about the Russian?

1011
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,288
I want you to bury him.

1012
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:47,873
All right.

1013
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:51,793
I think we should get you a new gun.

1014
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,712
But this time, try it.

1015
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,173
How far to the Russian's?

1016
01:08:56,381 --> 01:08:57,966
Be there in a minute.

1017
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:06,350
- Come on, then.
- No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1018
01:09:06,558 --> 01:09:09,561
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

1019
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:13,690
You shouldn't drink that stuff, anyway.

1020
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:15,525
Why? What's wrong with it?

1021
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,695
- It's not in sync with evolution.
- Shut up.

1022
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,322
How do we get rid of him?

1023
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,991
- Do you want to shoot him?
- It's a little noisy.

1024
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,244
- Do you want to stab him?
- That's a little cold-blooded.

1025
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:29,915
- Do you want to kill him or not?
- I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1026
01:09:30,123 --> 01:09:31,541
That's the spirit.

1027
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,251
Do they fire?

1028
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:34,753
Of course they fire.

1029
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,172
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

1030
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,341
What do you know about replicas?

1031
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,639
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1032
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:48,058
You wanted to know whether they worked.

1033
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:53,188
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1034
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,941
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1035
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:59,861
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

1036
01:10:00,028 --> 01:10:03,448
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1037
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,159
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1038
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:10,330
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1039
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,625
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1040
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,752
Let me do you a favor.

1041
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:21,883
Whoops.

1042
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,552
You. Want a knife?

1043
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,929
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

1044
01:10:26,179 --> 01:10:28,348
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1045
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,767
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

1046
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:34,438
The sharp side, a blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1047
01:10:56,793 --> 01:10:57,961
Is that Boris?

1048
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,523
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1049
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,359
What about Rosebud?

1050
01:11:21,526 --> 01:11:24,362
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1051
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:27,199
But which bit would you like?

1052
01:11:31,703 --> 01:11:32,788
They're getting out.

1053
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:35,999
Get down and follow them.

1054
01:11:36,249 --> 01:11:38,251
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1055
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,836
You're making a scene.

1056
01:11:40,128 --> 01:11:42,672
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1057
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:46,009
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1058
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:47,886
I can't leave him in here, can I?

1059
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:56,978
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1060
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:02,526
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1061
01:12:02,734 --> 01:12:06,488
- He's left the door open.
- Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1062
01:12:06,696 --> 01:12:08,156
Should we go in?

1063
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:11,827
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1064
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:16,122
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1065
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:19,835
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1066
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:23,004
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1067
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:26,967
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1068
01:12:27,425 --> 01:12:31,221
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1069
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:35,183
Well, come on then,
before "zee" Germans get here.

1070
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:37,686
You just tell him who's in charge.

1071
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,901
Boris...

1072
01:12:49,906 --> 01:12:51,408
You certainly told him.

1073
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:58,999
The Drowning Trout.

1074
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,458
The Drowning Trout.

1075
01:13:02,335 --> 01:13:05,213
Come and pick us up. And Doug...

1076
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:07,966
sharpish.

1077
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:31,031
I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face,

1078
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:34,910
but unless you give me what
I want, there will be fucking murders.

1079
01:13:37,662 --> 01:13:38,663
What's your name?

1080
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:40,540
Shoot him.

1081
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:51,593
Let go of the gun!

1082
01:13:57,432 --> 01:14:00,852
So, you're obviously the big dick...

1083
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:04,481
and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1084
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,609
There are two types of balls:

1085
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,322
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1086
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:15,033
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1087
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,869
Dicks have drive and clarity of vision...

1088
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,622
but they're not clever.

1089
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:24,209
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1090
01:14:25,168 --> 01:14:28,380
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy,

1091
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:31,883
and have brought your
two little faggot balls along,

1092
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:35,637
for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1093
01:14:37,305 --> 01:14:38,974
There's no pussy here...

1094
01:14:39,891 --> 01:14:43,395
just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1095
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,814
Like a prick...

1096
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,423
you're having second thoughts.

1097
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,236
You're shrinking.

1098
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,781
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1099
01:14:55,907 --> 01:14:59,369
The fact that you've got "Replica"
written on the side of your gun...

1100
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:09,087
and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle .50"...

1101
01:15:11,756 --> 01:15:13,550
written on the side of mine...

1102
01:15:18,346 --> 01:15:20,223
should precipitate...

1103
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:25,228
your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1104
01:15:27,522 --> 01:15:28,606
Now...

1105
01:15:31,317 --> 01:15:32,777
fuck off.

1106
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:49,627
Lock the door.

1107
01:15:49,919 --> 01:15:51,212
Lock it!

1108
01:15:57,093 --> 01:15:58,386
Give me the case.

1109
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:00,764
Fuck you.

1110
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:02,766
Shoot me.

1111
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:05,226
I will. I'll shoot you.

1112
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:18,323
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1113
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,784
You know what?

1114
01:16:20,992 --> 01:16:22,118
Fuck you too.

1115
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:25,997
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be
doing me a favor, you Russian fuck.

1116
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,958
You! Drop guns.

1117
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:30,502
Fuck you!

1118
01:16:30,668 --> 01:16:32,712
You drop your gun!

1119
01:16:34,005 --> 01:16:35,340
Okay.

1120
01:16:36,257 --> 01:16:37,425
Avi

1121
01:16:37,592 --> 01:16:38,760
pull your socks up!

1122
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,568
- Tyrone?
- Fuck it. We're out of here.

1123
01:16:56,694 --> 01:16:58,279
Give me case.

1124
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,210
Avi...

1125
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,463
- where's the case?
- Put the gun away.

1126
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:18,716
What's Boris doing here?

1127
01:17:19,717 --> 01:17:21,803
Boris, what are you doing here?

1128
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:24,013
Fuck you!

1129
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:34,023
Where's the case?

1130
01:17:35,441 --> 01:17:38,069
- You piece of crap.
- Don't take the piss, Boris.

1131
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,488
I'll show you.

1132
01:17:44,033 --> 01:17:45,618
Fuck you!

1133
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:51,457
Almost had it.

1134
01:17:51,749 --> 01:17:53,501
For fuck's sake.

1135
01:17:58,089 --> 01:17:59,757
Fuck you and all.

1136
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:04,095
You lucky bastard.

1137
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:12,353
Jeez, it's flawless.

1138
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,815
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1139
01:18:16,107 --> 01:18:17,275
Leave the dog here.

1140
01:18:17,483 --> 01:18:22,363
- Sol, why don't we just leave?
- Because life's too short, Vincent,

1141
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:25,450
and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1142
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,953
- Now leave that dog here.
- I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1143
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,288
Don't worry about it!

1144
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:34,167
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1145
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,045
It's okay.

1146
01:18:37,795 --> 01:18:39,631
Sit down. Down.

1147
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:47,680
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1148
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:50,183
Well, we won't if you don't.

1149
01:18:50,975 --> 01:18:53,019
All right, you give me the stone,

1150
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:57,148
and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1151
01:18:57,315 --> 01:19:01,527
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1152
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:06,658
Why is it down there?

1153
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,620
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1154
01:19:10,995 --> 01:19:12,795
You ain't from this planet, are you?

1155
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:16,834
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols

1156
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:20,838
sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1157
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:27,470
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle .50.

1158
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,181
What have they got to do with anything?

1159
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,684
They're both staring straight at me.

1160
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:40,024
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1161
01:19:40,191 --> 01:19:41,526
Now, out of the car.

1162
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:44,028
And leave your water pistols behind.

1163
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:48,574
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

1164
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:50,368
I'll think of something.

1165
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:56,291
Why's he sweating?

1166
01:19:58,501 --> 01:19:59,544
Oh, never mind.

1167
01:19:59,752 --> 01:20:02,505
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1168
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:06,843
- I'm a little worried, actually.
- Worried about what?

1169
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:11,264
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1170
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:13,558
I mean, he's done it before, hasn't he?

1171
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:17,854
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1172
01:20:18,604 --> 01:20:22,525
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1173
01:20:24,235 --> 01:20:28,364
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1174
01:20:28,614 --> 01:20:30,867
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

1175
01:20:31,075 --> 01:20:34,746
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1176
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:40,418
<i>You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.</i>

1177
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:44,088
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

1178
01:20:44,255 --> 01:20:47,425
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

1179
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:50,386
<i>What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?</i>

1180
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:52,847
We get murdered before leaving
the building,

1181
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:56,267
and I imagine we get fed to the pigs.

1182
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:00,438
So why are you so calm?

1183
01:21:01,397 --> 01:21:03,775
- I said...
- I heard what you said, Tommy!

1184
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,236
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

1185
01:21:07,403 --> 01:21:10,406
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy,

1186
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:15,119
and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1187
01:21:16,287 --> 01:21:18,956
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

1188
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,498
Oh, that fucking dog!

1189
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,459
Go on, get the dog.

1190
01:22:04,335 --> 01:22:07,630
- It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
- Open a window.

1191
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,057
You people live like animals.

1192
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:20,226
Now, where's the stone?

1193
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:22,687
- Come on, where is it?
- It's over here.

1194
01:22:22,895 --> 01:22:26,023
- Where? Where?
- I left it in a box.

1195
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,363
It's empty.

1196
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:35,658
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1197
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:38,703
No, I'm being serious!

1198
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,539
The dog. The dog must have ate it.

1199
01:22:45,084 --> 01:22:48,546
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1200
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:52,550
- What?
- Look in the dog.

1201
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,971
- You mean, "look in the dog"?
- I mean, open him up.

1202
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:04,562
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1203
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:06,772
You know what I mean.

1204
01:23:09,358 --> 01:23:10,401
That's a bit strong.

1205
01:23:12,361 --> 01:23:13,561
I don't know about this.

1206
01:23:14,947 --> 01:23:16,699
No, you can't do this.

1207
01:23:19,368 --> 01:23:20,870
It's fucking squeaking!

1208
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:25,124
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1209
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,378
I'm shooting the dog!

1210
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:39,388
Shoot the fucking dog!

1211
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:52,902
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1212
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:05,915
Thank God for that.

1213
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,637
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1214
01:24:22,598 --> 01:24:24,308
Tony, come on!

1215
01:24:32,608 --> 01:24:33,859
Tony?

1216
01:24:46,038 --> 01:24:48,958
- Anything to declare?
- Yeah. Don't go to England.

1217
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:55,381
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1218
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:57,800
How's the dog gonna find the campsite?

1219
01:24:58,009 --> 01:25:00,094
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1220
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:03,472
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1221
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:05,641
And we have to get rid of these bodies.

1222
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:09,186
That one with the tea cozy
on his head's starting to stink.

1223
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:14,567
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1224
01:25:17,737 --> 01:25:19,071
Mickey.

1225
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:22,325
Mickey!

1226
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:26,829
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1227
01:25:29,665 --> 01:25:30,833
Need a drink.

1228
01:25:33,502 --> 01:25:34,920
You can't give him a drink!

1229
01:25:35,212 --> 01:25:37,214
It's not for him. It's for me.

1230
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:44,847
Ah, mates. Amen.

1231
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:56,275
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.

1232
01:25:57,234 --> 01:25:58,611
All right, Mickey?

1233
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:00,738
Mickey!

1234
01:26:05,284 --> 01:26:07,036
Need to have a shite!

1235
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:12,583
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me

1236
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:15,252
shoot the bastards.

1237
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:20,049
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1238
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:28,557
All right, Tom.

1239
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:33,187
- Hope we get a better show this time.
- This will make up for it.

1240
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:36,107
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1241
01:26:36,315 --> 01:26:38,901
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1242
01:26:39,151 --> 01:26:40,695
Now, you have to forgive me.

1243
01:26:40,903 --> 01:26:43,656
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1244
01:26:46,909 --> 01:26:49,912
- Our lads at the campsite?
- They're over there now.

1245
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:55,459
I fucking hate pikeys.

1246
01:26:57,253 --> 01:27:01,298
- How long have we gotta stay here?
- As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1247
01:27:02,341 --> 01:27:04,343
Fucking hate pikeys.

1248
01:27:05,469 --> 01:27:07,471
Is he fucking stoned?

1249
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,974
He's like that before a fight.

1250
01:27:10,307 --> 01:27:12,643
Do you know when you're going down?

1251
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:15,438
Of course he knows when he's going down.

1252
01:27:15,646 --> 01:27:19,942
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1253
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:22,778
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1254
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:25,448
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1255
01:27:25,656 --> 01:27:28,993
- Not now.
- Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1256
01:27:29,201 --> 01:27:32,121
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to war.

1257
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:33,831
And they're none of yours.

1258
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:39,003
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

1259
01:27:39,211 --> 01:27:42,631
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1260
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:46,010
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1261
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:55,519
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

1262
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:49,073
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1263
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:51,450
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

1264
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:25,985
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

1265
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:09,987
Talk about saved by the bell.

1266
01:30:10,529 --> 01:30:14,074
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1267
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,577
<i>Do not knock him out, Mickey.</i>

1268
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,919
All right, let's break it up.

1269
01:30:58,911 --> 01:31:00,371
What, is he fucking deaf?

1270
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,582
What is he doing?

1271
01:31:19,348 --> 01:31:20,724
Come on and sit.

1272
01:31:23,477 --> 01:31:25,479
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1273
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:27,815
You're dancing like a fairy.

1274
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:30,734
<i>They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.</i>

1275
01:31:31,485 --> 01:31:33,654
Get out there and hurt him.

1276
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:39,952
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1277
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:03,160
<i>All he's got to do is stay down.</i>

1278
01:33:07,706 --> 01:33:09,917
<i>Now, we are fucked.</i>

1279
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:19,176
He can't stand up.

1280
01:33:19,384 --> 01:33:20,385
We're out of here.

1281
01:33:20,552 --> 01:33:25,599
<i>Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns</i>

1282
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:28,018
<i>sitting outside his campsite.</i>

1283
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:32,814
<i>Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.</i>

1284
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:35,942
<i>Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.</i>

1285
01:33:36,026 --> 01:33:38,111
<i>Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?</i>

1286
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:39,655
Give me that fucking shooter!

1287
01:33:39,863 --> 01:33:42,407
<i>And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.</i>

1288
01:33:42,616 --> 01:33:43,784
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1289
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:46,453
<i>Something very silly.</i>

1290
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:49,706
<i>You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you</i>

1291
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:52,543
<i>because you're too scared to think.</i>

1292
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:55,879
<i>You just freeze and pull a stupid face.</i>

1293
01:33:56,046 --> 01:33:58,340
<i>But the pikey didn't. Why?</i>

1294
01:33:58,549 --> 01:34:01,385
<i>Because he had plans
on running the car over.</i>

1295
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,889
<i>It had previously occurred to me</i>

1296
01:34:06,181 --> 01:34:09,101
<i>that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.</i>

1297
01:34:12,855 --> 01:34:15,649
<i>For every action, there is a reaction.</i>

1298
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:17,776
<i>And a pikey reaction...</i>

1299
01:34:18,443 --> 01:34:19,843
<i>is quite a fucking thing.</i>

1300
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:03,906
Pete, talk to me.

1301
01:35:04,114 --> 01:35:07,743
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1302
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:20,297
- Give me that fucking shooter.
- I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1303
01:35:28,263 --> 01:35:31,975
<i>That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.</i>

1304
01:35:32,976 --> 01:35:36,480
<i>That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.</i>

1305
01:35:38,273 --> 01:35:39,983
<i>We've been tucked up...</i>

1306
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:43,320
<i>while he's been cleaning up.</i>

1307
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:47,991
<i>We're worse off now than when we started.</i>

1308
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:55,999
<i>The next day we went to the campsite,</i>

1309
01:35:56,166 --> 01:35:59,336
<i>but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.</i>

1310
01:35:59,544 --> 01:36:01,546
<i>Which was probably a good thing</i>

1311
01:36:01,838 --> 01:36:06,051
<i>considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.</i>

1312
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,886
Where is he?

1313
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:10,347
He ain't fucking here, that's for sure.

1314
01:36:11,056 --> 01:36:14,601
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

1315
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:18,146
You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.

1316
01:36:20,023 --> 01:36:23,277
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1317
01:36:24,861 --> 01:36:26,697
Bollocks! Come on.

1318
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:35,122
- What you doing here?
- What's it got to do with you?

1319
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:40,794
So, what you doing here?

1320
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:51,638
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1321
01:36:53,181 --> 01:36:54,224
What's in the car?

1322
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:56,351
Seats and a steering wheel.

1323
01:36:57,185 --> 01:36:59,021
What do you know about gypsies?

1324
01:37:00,772 --> 01:37:02,774
I know they're not to be trusted.

1325
01:37:04,818 --> 01:37:07,571
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1326
01:37:08,363 --> 01:37:09,906
Get the dog, Tommy.

1327
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:13,285
The dog.

1328
01:37:14,578 --> 01:37:19,124
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1329
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:21,918
He loves that dog.

1330
01:37:22,085 --> 01:37:23,920
Always playing silly games.

1331
01:37:24,087 --> 01:37:27,591
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1332
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:34,139
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1333
01:37:44,941 --> 01:37:46,443
Could you tell me

1334
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:49,946
why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1335
01:37:50,614 --> 01:37:51,615
Hey, George...

1336
01:37:52,949 --> 01:37:55,160
is that a tea cozy on his head?

1337
01:37:58,538 --> 01:38:01,041
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

1338
01:38:10,884 --> 01:38:13,470
<i>Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.</i>

1339
01:38:13,678 --> 01:38:16,973
<i>I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.</i>

1340
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:20,060
<i>I couldn't stand that squeaking anymore.</i>

1341
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:23,730
<i>The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy,</i>

1342
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:27,317
<i>and an 84-karat diamond
lodged in its stomach.</i>

1343
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:30,362
<i>It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.</i>

1344
01:38:30,737 --> 01:38:32,739
<i>Still didn't shut it up, though.</i>

1345
01:38:33,657 --> 01:38:35,325
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1346
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:38,620
<i>You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.</i>

1347
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:40,497
So, what do you think?

1348
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:44,418
Do you know anyone who'd be interested?

1349
01:38:49,214 --> 01:38:50,215
I might.
